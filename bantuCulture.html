        <p>
            In central Africa, extending from the Atlantic ocean in the west, to the Kwango river in the east and from
            the great Congo river in the north, to the Kwanza river in the south reigned one of the greatest and richest
            cultural civilizations dated back into the stone age up to its sovereignty in the 13th century under their
            native great king LUKENI LUA NIMI before the Kongo civil war between 1665-1709 and to its abolishment in
            1914 by the Portuguese giving rise to secession and the birth of the present day Democratic Republic of
            Congo. The Kongo Empire was one of the biggest empires in its region. The highest population estimates for
            it place the amount at around 3.9 million people living inside the borders of the main kingdom. Its origins
            according to oral traditions is the large Bantu kingdom Mpemba Kasi south of modern day Matadi in DRC. Its
            capital city was called Mbanza Kongo, and was located in modern day Angola. The city was renamed Sao
            Salvador in the late 16th century, a name that stuck till Angolan independence.
        </p>

        <p>
            Between 1483-1485 according to Diego cao, a Portuguese explorer, the kingdom opened up to Christianity
            through their ruler and great king NZINGA A NKUWU who also accepted and converted to Christianity with his
            principal nobles and his citizens opening up a new education system seeing the starting of the first school
            and an exposure to a new cultural era notable by the changing of the kings native name from NZINGA A NKUWU
            to JOAO I in honor of the Portuguese king. He would have faced serious challenges due to this especially
            from his half-brother MPANZU A KITIMA though he overcame him at a battle waged at MBAZA KONGO. It is
            believed that the king later reverted back to his traditional and cultural beliefs unlike AFONSO I who
            established Christianity as the state religion of the whole kingdom.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Kongo system was supported by the Kongo church, kongolese school teachers or mestres who provided
            religious instructions and services to others building upon Kongo's growing population. They permitted the
            growth of syncretism and other forms of Christianity incorporating older religious ideas safeguarding their
            original culture though the church known as NZO A UKISI with part of the European clergy would have
            denounced these mixed traditions and cultures but were unable to root them out as the Bantu Africans were
            loyal to their roots and course.
        </p>


        <p>
            According to Cantino atlas (1502), Kongo was a source of slaves for the island of Sao Tome, Portuguese and
            other European powers marking the verge of the spread of the Kongo Bantu culture to the outside world
            including the eighteenth and nineteenth century crucifixes showing Jesus as an African, marking them a
            central part in the Christian world. According to Portuguese documents, the kingdom consisted of an army of
            archers and a smaller corps of heavy infantry fighting with swords and carrying shields for protection known
            as fidalgos or shield bearers. Sources furthered that thousands of women supported armies of the king who
            fielded as large as 70,000 soldiers as in the battle of Mbwila (1665). When the Portuguese arrived in Kongo,
            they were added as a mercenary force to this under their own commander using special weapons such as
            crossbows and muskets.
        </p>
        <p>
            In its vastness, the VATA village also LIBATA according to Kongo and Portuguese documents was the basic
            social cultural unit after the family known as NKULUTU or Mocolunto. Chiefs headed the villages which were
            grouped in Wene, small states led by Awene/Mwene or Mani. The king appointed and technically had powers to
            dismiss the Mwene MBAMBA but the political situations could have limited the king’s exercise of his powers.
            The kingdom was made up of fifteen principal provinces governed in consent by the royal council
            MBANDA-MBANDA or “the top of the top”. The Kongo people were divided into many subgroups which have many
            cultural similarities which has a well relative naturalism of the representation of humans and animals
            produced for social, cultural and politics for leaders as their king. The central Bantu groups in Kongo
            passed on status through matrilineal succession and women in this at various times, had ruler-ship and war
            roles as QUEEN NZINGA or Njinga who ruled in the 17th century for forty years.

            The indigenous people of Congo are accepted and endorsed by their government as well as the civil society
            organizations in present day Congo referring to the four main Bantu groups named: The MBUTI (Bambuti), THE
            BAKA (Bacwa), THE BATWA (Twa) of the west and THE BATWA (Twa) of the east. Though their exact number is
            unknown, its estimated that they take 3% of the population equating to 2,000,000 peoples who live in nomadic
            and sub-nomadic groups in ten of the country’s eleven provinces closely linked to the forests and its
            resources enriching their way of life lived from hunting, gathering, collecting and fishing as well as
            treating their illnesses with the help of their pharmacopoeia and medicinal plants derived from their
            natural forest setting which takes up 65% therefore forming the heart of their culture and living
            environment.
