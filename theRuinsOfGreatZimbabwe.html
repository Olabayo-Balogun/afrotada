                </h3>
                <p>
                    The ruins of Great Zimbabwe – the capital of the Queen of Sheba, according to an age-old legend –
                    are
                    a unique testimony to the Bantu civilization of the Shona between the 11th and 15th centuries. The
                    city, which covers an area of nearly 80 ha, was an important trading centre and was renowned from he
                    Middle Ages onwards.

            Great Zimbabwe National Monument is approximately 30 km rom asvingo
            and located in the lowveld at an altitude of some 1100 m in a sparsely populated region of the
            Bantu/Shona people. The property, built between 1100 and 1450 AD, extends over almost 800 ha and
            is divided into three groups: the Hill Ruins, the Great Enclosure and the Valley Ruins.



        </p>

        <p>
            The Hill Ruins, forming a huge granite mass atop a spur facing north-east/south-west, were
            continuously inhabited from the 11th to 15th centuries, and there are numerous layers of traces of
            human settlements. Rough granite rubble-stone blocks form distinct enclosures, accessed by narrow,
            partly covered, passageways. This acropolis is generally considered a 'royal city'; the west enclosure is
            thought to have been the residence of successive chiefs and the east enclosure, where six steatite upright
            posts topped with birds were found, considered to serve a ritual purpose. The Great Enclosure, which
            has the form of an ellipsis, is located to the south of the hills and dates to the 14th century. It was
            built
            of cut granite blocks, laid in regular courses, and contains a series of daga-hut living quarters, a
            community area, and a narrow passage leading to a high conical tower. The bricks (daga) were made
            from a mixture of granitic sand and clay. Huts were built within the stone enclosure walls; inside each
            community area other walls mark of each family's area, generally comprising a kitchen, two living huts
            and a court.



        </p>

        <p>
            Scientifc research has proved that Great Zimbabwe was founded in the 11th century on a site which
            had been sparsely inhabited in the prehistoric period, by a Bantu population of the Iron Age, the
            Shona. In the 14th century, it was the principal city of a major state extending over the gold-rich
            plateaux; its population exceeded 10,000 inhabitants. About 1450, the capital was abandoned because
            the hinterland could no longer furnish food for the overpopulated city and because of deforestation.
            The resulting migration benefted Khami, which became the most infuential city in the region, but
            signaled waning political power. When in 1505 the Portuguese settled in Sofala, the region was divided
            between the rival powers of the kingdoms of Torwa and Mwene-Mutapa.
