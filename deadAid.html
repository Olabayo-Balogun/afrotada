        <p>
            As the global pandemic persists, with countries shut down slowly opening their borders, there is no
            doubt there is bound to be a global financial crisis. Unfortunately, the world's least responsible
            individuals, the majority poor, will be the ones most affected.

        </p>

        <p>
            In my country, Kenya, as in many other African countries, we have received grants and funds from all
            western countries and global organizations. But why are they not getting to the person at the end of
            the food chain? Dambisa Moyo poses an exciting challenge to the viability of international aid,
            especially to African countries.

        </p>

        <p>
            Originally from Zambia, she has spent over ten years at Goldman Sachs as head of economic research
            and sub-Saharan Africa. Before that, she was positioned as a consultant at the World Bank. She holds
            a Ph.D. in economics from Oxford University and a master's degree from Harvard University's John
            F. Kennedy School of Government. She is well within her depths to have a thought piece on these
            matters.

        </p>

        <p>
            Moyo comes off as erratic, calling AID ineffective and "malignant." She quotes that despite more than
            $1 trillion in supposed development aid to Africa over the past 50 years, it has unimpressively failed
            to deliver any economic growth or reduce poverty. If anything, average incomes have gone even lower,
            making the continent worse off. Moyo, after her analysis, offers an alternative to financial
            development.

        </p>

        <p>
            She presents her case by saying, “Between 1970 and 1998, when aid flows to Africa were at their peak,
            poverty in Africa rose from 11 percent to a staggering 66 percent.” Currently, Africa is the only
            continent where life expectancy is less than age 60. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most impoverished region globally, where literacy, health, and other social indicators have plummeted
            since the 1970s.            

        </p>
        <p>
            Taking us through a history crash course of aid, Moyo highlights the many ways in which world events
            curate its intentions and form. She carefully dismantles the assumptions of International
            Development Association graduates that demand pledging to proposed economic policies. “By
            thwarting accountability mechanisms, encouraging rent-seeking behavior, siphoning away talent, and
            removing pressures reform inefficient policies and institutions aid guarantees that social capital
            remains weak and countries poor.” Her naughty list of aid goes on- including how stakes are raised for
            conflict.

        </p>

        <p>
            How do we get out of here? What do we do?

        </p>

        <p>
            In her proposal, she asks, “What if, one by one, African countries each received a phone call, telling
            them that in exactly five years the aid taps would be shut off —permanently? The shock would force
            them to create a new economic plan that phases in alternative financing mechanisms as aid is phased
            out,” she argues.

        </p>

        <p>
            These financing methods should include increased trade (particularly among African nations and
            emerging markets, foreign direct investment, venturing into global capital markets, and an increase in
            domestic savings through bank payments and microfinance. The goal is to phase out reliance on aid
            down to 5 percent or less within five years.

        </p>

        <p>
            Does it sound unattainable? That's because it will not be easy, but it is possible. Implementation of
            this new plan must contain political will and rallied by western activists, since they have the bargaining upper hand to drive change.

        </p>

        <p>
            Though it is hard to tell how her prescriptions will sway in the face of a global recession, she
            encourages us to think before we act. She goes deeper into the development conversation, which has
            become more vibrant lately, especially with the rise of corruption and embezzlement of aid funds
            meant for covid 19 cushioning in developing countries.
