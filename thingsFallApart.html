        <p>
            Things Fall Apart is a classic which portrays Igbo culture, struggles against modernization as seen through the life of Okonkwo; a man with daddy issues in the sense that his father lazy and laissez-faire attitude to life is everything he doesn’t want to be even when it means he has to go through life no expressing his true emotions except anger, manliness and other traits in direct opposition to his father characters.

        </p>

        <p>
            Okonkwo is a man whose perceived failings of his father weighs down and motivates so much that he can’t enjoy the off-season festivities between harvest time and the next planting season as he would much rather be working in his farm from dusk till dawn only if it wasn’t forbidden to do so. Even when very concerned, he hides his emotions under his macho veneer as seen when the agbala priestess demands for his second wife’s daughter Ezinma(an abiku) and takes her around the surrounding villages. While her mother Ekwefi was distressed and followed the priestess, Okonkwo merely brought out his snuff-bottle and cleared his throat only for him to secretly go to the shrine himself after some time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Things Fall Apart introduces the reader to the Igbo justice system delivered through a jury of sorts consisting of village elders bedecked in masquerade attires and who represented the spirit of the ancestors. A fair hearing is guaranteed in such a system regardless of position or wealth as anyone can petition the elders.
        </p>


        <p>
            The final part of the book deals with the disquiet and disruptive nature of the coming of missionaries and the colonial government of which Okonkwo was one of the fiercest opponents especially when his first son Nwoye abandons the old ways and accepts the newcomers' religion which was partly motivated at the pain and confusion he had been harbouring from a younger age when a young boy named Ikemfuna who had fostered in Okonkwo’s household for three years on instructions from the village council was sacrificed; this incident had a permanent influence on Nwoye and eventually motivated him to accept the newcomers' religion leading to his ostracization by his father. Okonkwo’s opposition was so vehement that it led to him being imprisoned by the district authority and later motivated him to kill the head messenger of the district officer who had come to break up a town hall meeting, his disillusion and disgust at his clansmen inaction and letting the rest of the messengers made him realize they would never rise and go to war against the white men as he wanted and led to him committing suicide which was the end of Okonkwo the fearless warrior who had threw Amalinze the cat and built his wealth from humble beginnings.
