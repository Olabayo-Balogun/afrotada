        <H3>Background</H3>
        Ethiopia is a land-locked country located in Eastern part of Africa bordering Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya,
        Somalia, Eritrea, Djibouti. The word Ethiopia means the land of burnt-faced people or the land of black people.
        The country originated from the ancient Aksumite Kingdom from the first century AD. It was ruled predominantly
        by the Solomonic Dynasty which ruled the Ethiopian Empire from 1270 to 1975 upon the death of Haile Selassie.
        Ethiopia is a multi-cultural and multi-ethnic country with the second highest population in Africa of about 114
        million people. This implies that the country has a diverse set of cultural practises dictated by ethnicity,
        geographic locations and religion of the Ethiopian people.

        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Habesha culture</h3>
        Between 1483-1485 according to Diego cao, a Portuguese explorer, the kingdom opened up to Christianity
        through their ruler and great king NZINGA A NKUWU who also accepted and converted to Christianity with his
        principal nobles and his citizens opening up a new education system seeing the starting of the first school
        and an exposure to a new cultural era notable by the changing of the kings native name from NZINGA A NKUWU
        to JOAO I in honor of the Portuguese king. He would have faced serious challenges due to this especially
        from his half-brother MPANZU A KITIMA though he overcame him at a battle waged at MBAZA KONGO. It is
        believed that the king later reverted back to his traditional and cultural beliefs unlike AFONSO I who
        established Christianity as the state religion of the whole kingdom.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Religion</h3>
        The Country has a deep interest in culture preservation and has conserved their ancient alphabets, calendar,
        religion, among other practices. It shares some religious practises with the neighbouring nations, Arabs and
        Mediterranean cultures.
        The Ethiopian Orthodox Church is one of the oldest religious organizations in the world with its roots dating
        back to 4 BC. Almost a half of the population belong to the organization, some practice the ancient Judaism
        beliefs while others are Muslim in religion.

        </p>


        <p>
        <h3>Ethnic Associations</h3>
        Ethiopia has 87 native spoken languages from different ethnic groups spread across the nation. The large ones
        are the Oromo, the largest ethnic group, who occupy the Oromia region, the Amharas who occupy the Amhara area
        and the Tigrayans in the Tigray region. The relationship of the tribes has been good for the better part of
        history despite some political influence that strategically creates division for political gains. Amhara is the
        official language of the country despite being from an ethnic group that is the second largest.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Coffee</h3>
        Ethiopia is well known for coffee plantations and is the 5th largest coffee-producing country in the world.
        Therefore coffee forms an essential part of Ethiopian daily activities and most importantly in its culture.
        Coffee making and drinking is a ritualized process that takes about one hour to create.
        ‘Buna dabo naw’ is a famous Ethiopian saying that means ‘coffee is our bread’. Coffee establishes a central role
        in any Ethiopian dietary practices. Coffee in Ethiopia is more than a common beverage drink. ‘Buna Tetu’ is also
        another famous Amharic phrase meaning ‘Drink Coffee’ which points to the social aspect of Ethiopian coffee just
        as the western cultures say ‘let’s meet for coffee’.
        The process has to be systematic from the start to finish. Women or young boys roast coffee from dried raw
        coffee beans in charcoal. Then the roasted beans are hand-ground and finally added to boiling water. Sugar is
        added to the mixture in small cups. One is required to inhale the sweet aroma before slowly sipping the coffee.

        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Hospitality</h3>
        Ethiopians have a welcoming culture where they like entertaining and refreshing their guests with food and
        drinks. It’s a common practise to remove shoes while entering an Ethiopian house and to dress in a presentable
        manner. A host sometimes might feed a guest using his hand, a practise known as ‘gursa’ to show oneness. After
        finishing the meal, the guests wash their hands and are given another round of coffee drinks.
