    <p>
      An interesting book about the writings of the founding president of the African National Congress
      (ANC) youth league, AM Lembede who held an MA Philosophy and an LLB. Despite coming from a
      very humble background, even by black standards, through discipline and self-study, Lembede
      managed to acquire a high level of education and took it upon himself to partake of the struggle for a
      free South Africa. He argued that the fact that the ANC at the time was led by a group of elite Africans
      who wanted change by constitutional means was the primary source of lethargy in the ANC in the
      1940s and hence the necessity of creating the ANCYL to inject militancy into the movement. Lembede
      was one of the authors of the first constitution of the ANCYL.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lembede argued that the role of the young is to be a conscience of any movement that is driving the
      people towards freedom and away from oppression and in the context of African politics in an age of
      messianic politics, it is important that the young in the progressive movements ask themselves if they
      are fulfilling this role adequately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lembede was a fervent christian and an Africanist with a keen dislike for communism and he believed
      that the class question is secondary to the race question. It appears that his affinity for christianity
      and the Marxist rejection of religion drove him towards a rejection of Marxism and in his writings, he
      states that the two are irreconcilable. As someone who believes that the class question precedes the
      race question, I found Lembede's reasoning as somewhat cogent but not persuasive enough to make
      me reconsider my thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps the biggest take away from the book is how Lembede was both a theoretician and a doer. He
      put the lives of his peoples ahead of his own and applied his abilities as a thinker and supplemented
      them by doing in pursuit of the liberation of his peoples. Itâ€™s a pity that he only lived until the age of
      33 and not much is written about his story. I recommend the book as it perhaps exposes some of the
      contradictions, on the class and race question, that were in South Africa's liberation movement and
      the thoughts of one of the key actors during that epoch of history
