                </h3>
                <p>
                    Khami Ruins National Monument is located to the west of the Khami River, 22 km rom he City of
                    Bulawayo.
                    The property, located on a 1300 m hilltop downstream from a dam built during 1928-1929, covers an
                    area of
                    about 108 ha, spread over a distance of about 2 km rom he Passage Ruin to the North Ruin.

            <div id="historicalSiteSnippetImage" class="col-6">

        <p>
            The property was the capital of the Torwa dynasty, which arose from the collapse of the Great Zimbabwe
            Kingdom between 1450 -1650 and was abandoned during the Ndebele incursions of the 19th century. It is
            composed of a complex series of platforms of dry-stone walled structures, emulating a later development of
            Stone Age culture. The chief’s residence (Mambo) was located towards the north on the Hill Ruin site with
            its
            adjacent cultivation terraces. The population lived in daga huts of cobwork, surrounded by a series of
            granite
            walls. These structures display a high standard of workmanship, a great number of narrow passageways and
            perambulatory galleries and impressive chevron and chequered wall decorations. Khami conforms to Great
            Zimbabwe in a number of archaeological and architectural aspects but it possesses certain features
            particular to
            itself and its successors such as Danangombe and Zinjanja. Revetments or retaining walls found expression
            for
            the frst time in the architectural history of the sub-region at Khami, and with it were elaborate
            decorations; it
            still has the longest decorated wall in the entire sub-region.



        </p>

        <p>
            The architecture of the site and the archaeological artefacts provide evidence for an exceptional
            understanding of
            strong, united, early civilizations. They also ofer information on the property’s complex socio-economic,
            religious and spiritual signifcance for the local communities and for the overall chronological development
            of
            Zimbabwe tradition; initiated in Mapungubwe (South Africa), extending to Great Zimbabwe, and through the
            emergence of later states. The archaeological remains are also a testament to long-distance historic trade
            links
            with the Portuguese, and the wider world, the diverse range of imported artefacts provide evidence of 15th
            and
            17th century Spanish porcelain, Rhineland stoneware and Ming porcelain, many of which are on display in the
            Museum of Natural History in Bulawayo. There is also a monumental granite cross which illustrates the
            contact
            with missionaries at a traditionally revered and sacred spiritual site.


        </p>
        <p>
            Khami is the second largest stone built monument in Zimbabwe. Its historical importance lies in its position
            at
            the watershed between the history of Great Zimbabwe and the later Zimbabwe period. It is one of the few
            Zimbabwe sites that were not destroyed by treasure hunters and its undisturbed stratigraphy is scientifically
            important in providing a much clearer insight into the history of the country.
