        <p>
            Stay With Me is a story of deceit, love, betrayal and pain. It is set in Nigeria’s military regime and tells the story of Yejide, a naïve young virgin who marries the love of her life, Akin in her final year of university. But unknowingly to her, Akin is impotent. Years into the marriage, the pressure of childbirth increased. And like every other typical African society, when children weren’t forthcoming in the marriage, all fingers pointed at Yejide. All the solutions, medical and spiritual from family and friends were directed at her. However, One popular solution, usually by the extended family in many Arican homes faced with the issue of childlessness is to bring in another woman, and so Yejide and Akin’s marriage was not exempted from this. Thus, Akin’s mother, oblivious of her son’s fertility problems brings in Funmi, as a second wife for Akin, but unlike Yejide, Funmi has some sexual expertise which she used in discovering Akin’s impotence before Funmi.  Akin then goes ahead to connive with his younger brother, Dotun who was aware of his condition to seduce Yejide and get her pregnant. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Akin put together a well calculated plan of parenthood without consulting Yejide. His masterplan was simply four weekends, four sexual experiences with Dotun and four kids, 1 year each apart. Unfortunately, biology foiled Akin’s plan. While he was plotting this perfect graph for parenthood, he didn’t take into cognizance any biological interferences or like genotype. Yejide and Dotun were biologically incompatible owing to genotype leading her to lose two children to sickle cell disease and eventually walking away from the third child, for fear of the unknown. The story basically revolves around the themes of marriage, children, infertility, religion, polygamy (family) and politics.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I particularly liked about the book was the character build up. Each character felt real and relatable, and with every page, I saw myself acting out the scenes in my head. My favourite character is definitely Yejide. I loved her character not because of her experiences in the story but in the way she owned the role, or maybe it was just Ayobami’s good writing.. I also loved how suspense thrilled the story was, as I kept making guesses of what was going to happen next and drawing up conclusions in my head. For instance, when Yejide lost her first child, I had concluded that it was a spiritual problem. Alas, I was wrong.
            My least favourite character was Dotun. This is mostly because his character showed a great level of irresponsibility, and he was the instrument used to fuel the fire in Yejide’s home.

        </p>


        <p>
            The most intriguing part of the book was explored through the theme of religion. This part of the book emphasizes the importance of the ‘God’ factor and faith in the life of every religious person, in this case, Yejide. Shockingly, the story makes a twist when modern medicine trumped religion in that Yejide’s first pregnancy was merely psychological. It is not uncommon in African societies to hear of ‘miraculous’ reproductive stories where religion is believed to trump modern medicine. Thus, I imagined that Yejide’s pregnancy will turn out to be one of those uncommon testimonies, but it wasn’t. it was a phantom pregnancy. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My favourite part of the book was when Yejide became woke. When she discovered Akin’s cruel masterplan. The day she solved the puzzle that was her life. The day she saw the light after being in darkness for too long. In her own words,<q>…the past flipped itself open like a spooky family album, revealing one familiar picture after the other, highlighting the things standing in plain view, which I had never seen. Things I had refused to see…</q>
        </p>

        <p>
            However, the story telling could have been better. There were inconsistencies in who was speaking and at what point. This inconsistency in the voice of the book started out from the beginning, so those with very low attention span may lose interest after the first few pages. Akin’s persona was also quite vague. There were scenes where the writer painted Akin as the affectionate husband, brother and son and at other times, it seemed like I was reading about another character. The theme of politics was also unnecessary to me. The book does a spectacular job on the theme of family, the segue into politics seemed like some digression. Secondary characters like Iya Bolu who later became Yejide’s only friend could have been given more life. Funmi, Yejide’s co-wife could also have developed a little bit more.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, Yejide’s experiences are very relatable to many women. She was raised in a society that places the value of women on their reproductive ability but exonerates man from the same standard. She lived in a society where infertility is automatically a woman’s fault. Thus, the solution to most childless marriages is usually ‘another woman or wife’, never another man because the woman is always the problem. The solution is never ‘has he checked himself?’ but always ‘is she okay?’. Yejide lived in a society where men feel entitled to women bodies to the extent that they make decisions for them. This entitlement is why Akin makes life decisions about reproduction for Yejide without first consulting her. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this twenty-first century, the book is an eye opener into issues such as sex, genotype, children and adoption for those who claim to be in love, and why these conversations are necessary conversations to be held before a life commitment such as marriage. It also leaves us with some unanswered questions about love and relationships. For instance, would Yejide have married Akin if he initially told her of his fertility problem?  is your partner open to adoption? Since sex is a compulsory element in marriage, shouldn’t sexual compatibility not be a criterion for marriage? What extent are you willing to go to save a marriage? Should genotype be a first date question? All of these and more are questions to reflect on from the book.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally, the book is pleasurable to read, and its unpredictability makes it stand out for me.
