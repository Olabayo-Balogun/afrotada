        <p>
            A country located in the northeastern corner of Africa, known for its rich history and culture that dates to
            thousands of years ago. The history of Egypt is so wide and it is divided into series namely: Ancient Egypt,
            Greco-Roman Egypt, Medieval Egypt, Early Modern Egypt and finally Late Modern Egypt. One could write a whole
            book on the culture of Egypt and it still would not be enough to capture all the facts. Therefore, our focus
            for now will be on Ancient Egypt Culture because not only has it left a lasting legacy, but it’s also
            considered one of the greatest and most powerful civilizations in the history of the world!
        </p>

        <p>
            Ancient Egypt lasted for over 3000 years, from around 3150 BC to its conquest by Alexander the Great in 332
            BC. Historians divide the history of Egypt into three major kingdoms called the Old Kingdom, the Middle
            Kingdom and the New Kingdom, which were separated by periods of instability known as intermediate periods.
            Ancient Egypt was rich in culture including its government, religion, writing, the unmatched beauty of its
            arts and the success of its architecture, which up to date is a main tourist attraction in Egypt. The
            Ancient Egyptians were scientists and mathematicians and they invented many things like how to build
            buildings, medicine, cosmetics, the calendar, farming tools, and musical instruments.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Ancient Egypt, the Pharaoh was the most important figurehead. He governed the people of Egypt, served as
            the Head Priest and the commander-in-chief of the army. The Ancient Egyptians were one of the first
            civilizations to invent writing and only the scribes could read and write as it was considered sacred.
            Djoser was the first Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom (the Age of Pyramids) and was responsible for the
            construction of one of the first pyramids to be built by the Ancient Egyptians. His step pyramid at Saqqara
            began the culture of building pyramids as burial places for the Pharaohs. During this period, only the
            Pharaoh was believed to have an afterlife and was buried with treasure which was said to help in the
            afterlife. The pyramids were built on the West side of River Nile where the sun set could easily meet Re
            (the sun and creator God). And surprisingly, mentioning the Pharaoh’s name is strictly forbidden in the Old
            Kingdom. But the interesting part about the culture of the Old Kingdom (in my opinion) was that the women
            were highly respected. They owned land and passed it down to their daughters, which was contrary to other
            comparable societies.
        </p>


        <p>
            The Middle Kingdom was also known as the “Golden Age”. Turquoise and copper were mined during this period;
            and they buried their Pharaohs in hidden tombs. Coffin texts were created during the middle kingdom and
            writing during this period was for storytelling and not just keeping records.
        </p>
        <p>
            The New kingdom, which was also known as the Imperial Age, brought Egypt luxury, power and wealth. The
            influence of gold mines in Nubia helped them flourish. During this period, the construction of pyramids
            ended and the Pharaohs were buried in the Valley of Kings in rock tombs.
            Other cultural facts about Ancient Egypt were that both men and women wore makeup which they believed had
            healing powers and protected their skin from the sun. Also, cats were considered magical creatures capable
            of bringing good luck to those that housed them. In conclusion, Ancient Egyptians clearly had a rich culture
            and they are one of the reasons why people still travel to Egypt to witness their cultural sites.
