    <p>
      In 2011, when I was just in my second year of secondary school, my mother sent me a copy of
      Unbowed, Wangari Maathai's memoir, along with her monthly letter that was usually accompanied by
      a book. When I read it, I fell in love with the words. It’s like they rose off the book for an audience
      with me. Creating an impact so great, the school board went ahead and appointed me for the position
      of Minister for Environment in the student council, because of the environmentally conscious
      initiatives I was undertaking. I loved it so much that should I ever have a daughter, her first name
      would be Wangari, and my affirmations for her will be the strength and will she carried.

    </p>

    <p>
      The grace and poise in which she beautifully accepted her Nobel Peace Prize in 2004, had every
      Kenyan want to hug a tree out of love and admiration. Even with her new found world fame, her
      vision was clear and precise, to continue planting trees. Contrary to her advisors who wanted her to
      tour the world and launch campaigns that would attract donor funds. She chose home, where her
      heart was. Requests from local primary schools to plant trees, she gave the same weight and attention,
      as invitations to speak at Oxford.

    </p>

    <p>
      In this memoir, she explains how excited she was to come back home being among the first
      generation of young professionals who came back after studying overseas to help the country develop
      following independence in 1963. Her work in academia is notable, what sits most impressively for me,
      is her radical feminism when she served as the National Council for Women. Although she didn’t
      brand herself a feminist, her plight for women’s liberation has shaped the face of Kenyan feminism.


    </p>

    <p>
      For a country that has little tolerance for women and girls who don’t stay quiet, she challenged the
      presidency of Moi, risking her life and suffered public humiliation. This however, never deterred her or veer her
      off her course. She went on to become the first Kenyan woman to earn a PhD. She
      passionately fought for equal pay and demanded respect from her peers. She was repeatedly arrested
      and goes on to narrate her harrowing experiences with police Brutality that Kenya is still grappling
      with.

    </p>
    <p>
      Kenya, alarmingly, has less than 2 percent of indigenous forests left. And the number keeps
      depreciating due to illegal charcoal burning, land cleared for agriculture or to create room for
      squatters. What started as a commercial venture , became a way to alleviate the standards of living of
      rural women by paying them to plant trees at the same time tackling deforestation. Wangari then
      became a full-time coordinator of the Green Belt Movement, which boasts of planting more than 30
      million trees in Kenya.

    </p>
    <p>
      The Green Belt Movement has led environmentally political protests by opposing grabbing of public
      land by greedy politicians. Wangari cried out that rewarding of land to undeserving political allies
      began with British colonialists, which is how most of the agricultural land in Kenya was lost
      Unfortunately, not all kenyans appreciate the wealth and magnitude that is Maathai. Uhuru park,
      Karura Forest and central Park have not been turned into sky scrappers solely because of her efforts.

    </p>
    <p>
      Even though Wangari is considered as accomplished as Barack Obama, reading Unbowed, one gets
      the idea that no global peace Prize, could ever match for her, the glory of being accepted and
      celebrated at home.
