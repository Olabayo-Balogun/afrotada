            The Yoruba of people of West Africa who live chiefly in southwest Nigeria came into existence more than one
            thousand years ago. Accounts say they originate from Mecca in Saudi Arabia though Oduduwa. The Yorubas can
            be found in Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Ondo, Ekiti and Dkwara as well as Lagos states, parts of Kogi state of Nigeria
            and the adjoining parts of Benin republic and Togo, commonly known as Yorubaland. Oduduwa landed at Ife life
            and taught people the Ede Yoruba, Oduduwa is the father of all Yorubas.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Yoruba people believe that all human beings pass through what is known as Ayanmo which translates to
            destiny or fate. Furthermore the thoughts and actions of each person in Aye (the physical realm) interact
            with all living things including the earth itself. Each person living on earth attempts to achieve
            perfection and find their destiny in Orun-ree (the spiritual realm of those who do good and beneficial
            things) ones Ori-inu (spiritual consciousness in the physical realm) must grow in order to consummate union
            with ones Iponri (Ori orun spiritual self) Iwapele (or well balanced) meditative recitation and sincere
            veneration is sufficient to strengthen the Ori-inu of most people. Well-balanced people, it is believed they
            are able to make positive use of the simplest form of connection between their Oris and the omnipotent
            Olu-orun: an adura (petition or prayer) for divine support. Prayer to one's Ori Orun produces an immediate
            sensation of joy. Eshu Elegbara initiates contact with the spiritual realm on behalf of the petitioner, and
            transmits the prayer to Aye; the deliverer of Ase or the spark of life. He transmits this prayer without
            distorting it in any way. Thereafter, the petitioner may be satisfied with a personal answer. In the event
            that he or she is not, the Ifa oracle of the Orisha Orunmila may also be consulted. All communication with
            orun whether simplistic in the form of a personal prayer or complicated in the form of that done by and
            initiated by Babalawo (priest of divination), however, is energized by invoking Ase.

        <p>
            Yoruba religion consists of traditional religious and spiritual concepts and practices. Their god is called
            Olodumare who is the supreme deity. He is also known as Orise (the source of things), Olorun or Oluwa
            (lord). He lives in the sky and he is a distant god, and when it comes to everyday prayers, things are often
            handled by protectors called Orishas. Orishas are spirits/unique/special/deities/divinities/gods selected
            heads sent by Olodumare for the guidance of all creation and of humanity in particular, on how to live and
            be successful on earth. They are the intermediaries between Olodumare and the mankind. Orishas have control
            over specific elements of nature.They are thus also referred to as Imole. There are Orishas that are more
            supreme than others and are known as deities. Examples of Orishas are Orunmila who is the grand priest and
            custodian of Ifa oracle, source of knowledge who cures illnesses and deformities: Eshu; who deals with a
            hand of misfortunes to those that do not offer tribute or are deemed to be spiritual novices. He is the
            negotiator between positive and negative forces: Ogun is the lord of iron and metallurgy: Yemoja is the
            mother of waters and is believed to be amniotic fluid in the womb of a pregnant woman as well as breasts
            that nurture. She is considered the protective energy of the feminine force. Osun is associated with several
            powers including abilities to heal with cool water, induction of fertility and the control of the feminine
            essence. She elevates women disorders and she is fond of babies, she is sought if a baby becomes ill and she
            is known for her love of honey. Among others are Sango associated with virility and masculinity and also
            fire lighting, and Oya who is the guardian of the cemetery, winds of change, storms and progression. Yoruba
            also believes in Irunmole who are entities sent by Olorun to complete given tasks, Often acting as liaisons
            between Orun(the invisible realm) and Aiye (the physical realm). Irunmole can best be described as ranking
            divinities; whereby such divinities are regarded as the principal Orishas. She is the Orisha of rebirth.
            Oludumare rules over the universe and he has no gender.
        </p>


        <p>
            The Yorubas are embodied in Ifa divination and are known as the tripartite book of enlightenment in
            Yorubaland and in its diaspora. Olodumare gave Emi (the breath of life) to humankind. In this, Olodumare is
            supreme, and is considered the principal agent of creation. According to one of Yoruba beliefs of creation,
            at a certain stage in the process, the truth was sent to confirm the habitability of the planets that were
            newly formed. The earth being one of these was visited but considered too wet for conventional living. After
            sometime a number of divinities led by Obatala were sent to accomplish the mission of helping the earth
            develop its crust which he did gradually to a point where he made a large patch of dry land; the various
            indentations they made became hills and valleys. Obatala then named the place Ife. The land became fertile
            and plants began to grow and flourish. Olodumare also created explosions and began to bake and then released
            the breath of life to blow across the land and figurines slowly came into being as the first people of Ife.
            For this reason, Ife is locally referred to as Ife Oodaye â€“cradle of existence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Yorubas believe in Atunwa, reincarnation within the family. The names Babatunde (father returns, Yetunde
            (mother returns) , Babatunji (father wakes once again) and Sotunde (the wise man returns) all offer vivid
            evidence of the Ifa concept of family or lineal rebirth. There is no simple guarantee that your grandfather
            or great uncle will come back in the birth of your child, however whenever the time arrives for a spirit to
            return to earth through the conception of a new life in the direct bloodline of the family one of the
            component entities of a personâ€™s being returns, while the other remains in heaven (Ikole Orun).The spirit
            that returns does so in the form of a guardian Ori.
