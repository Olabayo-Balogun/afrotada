        <p>
            The book talks about the history of the Food Canning Workers Union (FCWU) from 1976 until it was
            absorbed as an affiliate of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), the book is also an
            autobiographical work of the authorâ€™s role in events that led to the restructuring and reformation of
            the FCWU into a vibrant workers organisation between 1976 until about 1986 when the author left the
            organisation.

        </p>

        <p>
            The book is split into roughly two parts, the first section deals with interesting details of how
            formation of the organisational culture took place as well as the role and relationship of the white left
            and other members of the intelligentsia in organising workers who in most cases did not have the
            technical capacity to run such organisations though it belonged to them. This section of the book
            made me raise the question about the politics of identity and class intersection. In a sector where the
            most oppressive bosses were typically white men, it took a white Afrikaans male to counter the bosses
            and stand up for workers which made sense as the author was technically capable of engaging in the
            complex discussions of wages as he had studied law. This, in my view, is tantamount to a technically
            competent man being Secretary-General of a feminist movement which in modern liberal circles
            would be generally unacceptable. Numerous times, the author does recognise this dilemma of his
            identity. Given the relatively low wages he was earning in comparison to the middle class life he would
            have attained, this dilemma of identity made it difficult for him to raise his own wages.


        </p>

        <p>
            In the second partition of the book the author talks about how politics and the neo-liberal agenda
            eventually triumphed over the organisation which from 1986 onwards was under the umbrella of COSATU and the author himself had stepped down to become a practising labour lawyer. The political
            goals of COSATU as a member of the tripartite alliance made the needs of workers subservient to
            those of the broader organisation even prior to 1994 according to the author and the centralised
            organisational structure of COSATU created more distance between the workers and those who
            represented them unlike the decentralised model the author had instituted during his time at FCWU.
            

        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, it is a book worth reading because of the detail it goes into. While most books marvel at the
            work people like Cyril Ramaphosa in the formation of COSATU, reading about less prominent names
            humanises this particular epoch of history a bit more and that is something the book manages to
            achieve, in my view.
