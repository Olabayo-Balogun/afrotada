                <h3>Giza Necropolis</h3>
                <p>
                    The Giza Necropolis occupies much of the Giza Plateau, 25Km south of Cairo, the Egyptian capital. Giza is the
name of this suburban city where the plateau is located. He is on the left bank of the Nile.

            </div>
        </section>

        <p>
            In aerial view it seems that only the northern part of the plateau is occupied by old buildings, but in fact it is
false, it is an impression due to the gigantism f the three pyramids. Graves have been found further to the west,
and the updated village of workers and their cemeteries extends the necropolis much further south than it seems.

        </p>

        <p>
            Memphis is located in the center of the foodplain of the western side of the Nile. Its fame comes from ts being
the frst Capital of Ancient Egypt. The unrivaled geographic location of Memphis, both commanding the
entrance to the Delta while being at the confuence of important trade routes, means that there was no possible
alternative capital for any ruler with serious ambition to govern both Upper and Lower Egypt. Traditionally
believed to have been founded in 3000 BC as the capital of a politically unifed Egypt, Memphis served as the
efective administrative capital of the country during the Old Kingdom, then during at least part of the Middle
and New Kingdoms (besides Itjtawy and Thebes), the Late Period and again in the Ptolemaic Period (along with
the city of Alexandria), until it was eclipsed by the foundation of the Islamic garrison city of Fustat on the Nile
and its later development, Al Qahira. As well as the home of kings, and the centre of state administration,
Memphis was considered to be a site sacred to the gods.

        </p>

        <p>
            The site contains many archaeological remains, refecting what life was like in the ancient Egyptian city, which
include temples, of which the most important is the Temple of Ptah in Mit Rahina. Ptah was the local god of
Memphis, the god of creation and the patron of craftsmanship. Other major religious buildings included the sun
temples in Abu Ghurab and Abusir, the temple of the god Apis in Memphis, the Serapeum and the Heb-Sed
temple in Saqqara. Being the seat of royal power for over eight dynasties, the city also contained palaces and ruins
of the palace of Apries overlooking the city. The palaces and temples were surrounded by craftsmenâ€™s
workshops, dockyards and arsenals, as well as residential neighbourhoods, traces of which survive.

        </p>

        <p>
            The Necropolis of Memphis, to the north and south of the capital, extends southwards from he Giza plateau,
through Zawyet Elarian, Abu Ghurab, Abusir, Mit Rahina and Saqqara, and northwards as far as Dahshur. It
contains the frst complex monumental stone buildings in Egyptian history, as well as evidence of the
development of the royal tombs from the early shape called "mastaba" until it reaches the pyramid shape. More
than thirty-eight pyramids include the three pyramids of Giza, of which the Great Pyramid of Khufu is the only
surviving wonder of the ancient world and one of the most important monuments in the history of humankind,
the pyramids of Abusir, Saqqara and Dahshur and the Great Sphinx. Besides these monumental creations, there
are more than nine thousand rock-cut tombs, from diferent historical periods, ranging from the First to the
Thirtieth Dynasty, and extending to the Graeco-Roman Period. The property also includes the remains of many
smaller temples and settlements, which are invaluable for understanding ancient Egyptian life in this area.
