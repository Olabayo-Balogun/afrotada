        <p>
            The book is a collection of the speeches of Thomas Sankara and a few of his writings. The brilliance
            and clarity of the speeches have the capacity to fill one with revolutionary fervour or to make one
            apathetic about the quality of leadership currently at the helm in African politics.


        </p>

        <p>
            A key aspect of this collection of speeches was the extent to which Sankara managed to discuss the
            intersection of class and identity in his speeches. In the speech "Who are the enemies of the people?",
            he rails against imperialism and equally rails against the enemies of the people who were inside the
            movement he led. He articulately sketched how the enemies of the people can be both men and
            women, black and white who have one thing in common, reactionary attitudes. Parts of this speech
            and many others read like a more accessible replica of "The Pitfalls of National Consciousness" by
            Franz Fanon. In a speech to women, Sankara skilfully, outlined the intersection of race and class in
            the context of women's struggles in society. While denouncing the white manâ€™s oppression in
            apartheid South Africa, he acknowledges the struggle of white women, while acknowledging the pain
            of black women in Africa and Burkina Faso, he outlines the limits of such solidarity in the context of,
            things he regarded as vices such as prostitution (which he acknowledged as an inevitable by-product
            of capitalism) and the pursuit of bourgeoisie lifestyles at the expense of the masses, by some women.
            Such nuance in speech is rare from political leadership in this age of social-media mobs of political
            correctness.



        </p>

        <p>
            TAnother thread that ran through his speeches was a disregard for messianic sloganeering in praise of
            leaders. He asks a poignant question of what happens when the leaders whom we praised go rogue? In a country where messianic leadership has its roots deep in liberation history and is prevalent in the
            major political parties, moving from this sad aspect of our politics will be incredibly difficult given
            how, forfeiting a messianic position would be to an extent equivalent to forfeiting power by a political
            leader.                       
            

        </p>

        <p>
            Sankara reasons that "power must be the business of conscious people" and that a "Revolution needs
            a people who are convinced, not conquered". In these speeches Sankara advocates for the importance
            of having a people who have decent theoretical, organisational, and ideological understanding of the
            direction in which he wanted to take the revolution forward. In these speeches he does acknowledge
            that a conscious people is a threat to an incompetent leader or politician and that some of the enemies
            of the people from within would not want such to happen.


        </p>
        <p>
            As someone who enjoys economics, my favourite speech was his proposition that Africa and the third
            world must unite and collectively refuse to pay debt, some of which originated from the colonial era.
            The COVID-19 crisis has again exposed the cyclical debt crises in Africa and it is a pity that African
            leaders have still not heeded Sankara and made the most of these repeated crises which tend to come
            in waves and hence affect many countries simultaneously therefore providing spaces for solidarity in
            resisting debt repayment or at the very least negotiating repayable debt matrices. On the economic
            front, Sankara repeatedly points out that any projects the nation must do must be targeted,
            manageable and have a direct and measurable impact on the lives of the poorest in society, rather
            than pursuing huge vanity projects from which the poor will only get "spill overs". His rejection of aid
            is something many African leaders can learn from just as Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore is another
            example of the power of rejecting aid. Sankara argues that aid can turn a nation into a client state
            living beyond its means at the mercy of foreign powers.

        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, the language and flow of the speeches is brilliant which makes the book readable rather than
            montone. A must read for anyone who identifies as an Africanist or anyone who is interested in
            radical and pragmatic ideas with a firm ideological and theoretical basis. This book is probably the
            book I have made the most highlights in.
