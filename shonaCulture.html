        <p>
            Within the heart of Southern Africa lies a Bantu speaking nation called the Zezuru people. They are
            also known as the Shona people, a name that was given to them by the Ndebele people when they
            arrived into the now Zimbabwe after they were running away from the wrath of Shaka Zulu during the
            Mfecane wars.
        </p>

        <p>
            Zezuru or Shona people are heterogenous people linguistically noting. Within the Zezuru tongue tree
            one can note that the tongue has sixteen sub-tongues, however, the tongues all end up at the doorstep
            of the Zezuru or ChiShona tongue. Naming the tongue and tribes that fall under the Zezuru family
            tree, there are the Kore-Kore people, MaNyika people, Ndau people, among other tribes and tongues
            that fall under the Zezuru family tree. The Zezuru people have a common template that dictate how
            they lead and live their lives. It is worth noting that the Zezuru people differ in some specific areas
            such as bridal/ lobola/ roora payment and funerals. One such example within the Zezuru people some
            groups are spontaneous they are extravagant when they are mourning their deceased. While others
            prefer to be quiet and reserved when they are handling the loss of their loved one.
            
        </p>

        <p>
            Understanding the Zezuru culture or Shona culture the group of people observe and respect
            ancestors. That is to the people believe that there is a divine spirit that has brought them to where
            they are and who they are. Therefore, this means that those who have gone before them become
            ancestors who carry their prayers and supplications to the creator. Within the realm of Zezuru
            spirituality each clan or tribe they identify themselves with specific animals. This then translates to
            their identity as a people for example there are Soko/Monkey, Lion/Shumba, Zebra/Dube/Mbizi/,
            Eland/ChiHera, Water/ Dziva, Heart/ Moyo, Boar/ Humba, Eagle/Hungwe the list is endless each
            totem serves as a distinction within each group of people. One can note this is a means and ways of
            forging bonds when someone comes into an area that she or he is new. What happens is that when
            people interact, they ask each other what each other’s totem is if they find a commonality within the
            totems themselves that person will not feel lonely, however, they vary.
            
        </p>


        <p>
            Zezuru people are a people who are reserved and are a peace-loving people. When faced with an
            imminent threat or there is an altercation that is brewing. Naturally or instinctively they try to find means of avoiding any altercation with the person. If they have wronged the person Shona people opt
            to find means of talking things out and they establish peace there and then. It is rare to witness a
            Shona person who resorts to violence as a means of correcting an error or venting out their
            frustration. When a Shona person resorts to violence that would be the last straw this then means that
            Shona people are patient people. There are animals within the Shina culture that are sacred and if one
            meets one in their lifetime or existence there is a significance to the person. The sacred animals are
            the Pangolin or Haka in Shona, the Batchelor Eagle, or Chapungu in Shona and Mbada or Leopard.
            The eagle is the one that is one the crest of Airforce of Zimbabwe. Shona people when they speak in
            their native tongue, some are direct, and others worm their way around as they are addressing a
            point. Furthermore, the MaNyika people when they are celebrating, they tend to keep things a secret.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding the Shona people culturally everything revolves around the woman. Within the culture
            there is a proverb that says, “Musha Mukadzi or Musha Mudzimai” translating “A home is woman”
            (direct translation), furthermore, there is a proverb that says, “Kugocha kunoda kwaAmai, kweMwana
            kunodzima moto” translation, “It needs the Mothers hand to do the job, the child will burn out the
            flame”. This the leads one to sum up the significance of women within the Zezuru culture in the 19th
            Century there was a Spirit medium who inspired the war of liberation struggle known as the
            Chimurenga which means war. The spirit medium is Ambuya NeHanda she inspired both wars for the
            liberation of Zimbabwe. Women within the Shona culture are given high regard and respect; however,
            it is saddening that nowadays that is nit the case as there are reports of gender-based violence are
            making headlines each day. The Shona culture is a conservative culture that takes time to appreciate
            to the changes in society, that is to hint at the global trends as the world seeks to embrace
            individuality the Shona society is interwoven that is to say appreciating the changes in society from a
            macrocosm trickling down to the microcosm Shona people will take time to adapt and adopt the changes. The reasoning one can note is that that is who they are as a people it is woven in the people’s
            identity.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Zezuru people are a people who are industrious and poetic in everything that they do. It is evident
            from the establishment of vast and mighty empires such as the Great Zimbabwe or Masvingo, the
            Munhumutapa Empire whose influence reached as far as the coast of the Indian Ocean. Shona people
            are an agriculturally inspired people they hold dearly and cherish dearly land. Shona people are
            poetic, and they are sculptures naturally many soap stone artefacts have dawned many exhibitions
            globally for example the Zimbabwean birds who have been in British museums for centuries. Many
            artists and creators they note that their inspirations stem from dreams. The spirit world plays an
            important role in the people’s identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Food plays a key pillar in identifying Shona people, there is a Shona proverb that says, “Hukama
            igasva huno zadzikisiwa nekudya” direct translation, “food is a connecting factor that brings people
            together”. The main staple carbohydrate-based diet is corn, pounded or grounded corn cooked
            becomes Sadza. Sadza is eaten along with anything, vegetables, meat, beans, eggs, tomatoes and
            onion and many other side dishes can be incorporated with Sadza. Traditionally Sadza is eaten using
            hands and is moulded in the palm into small lumps. The process itself is philosophical. The moulding
            of the Sadza morsel into a ball; the circular motion can be interpreted as a person when he or she
            needs help to get the job done. This is supported by a Shona proverb that says, “Chara chimwe hachi
            tswanyi inda” direct translation “One finger or hand cannot crush a lice”.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Zezuru people are a people who have a strong firm heritage, a culture that has been passed on
            from one generation to the other through word of mouth “Oral tradition” and written books. What determines the Shona cultures existence in the globalised world are the people themselves the
            custodians of the tongue and culture.
